# Equivariant quantum neural networks
This repository aims to implement the Equivariant Quantum machine-learning model in various symmetries. This repository represents part of the work I have done for my Google Summer of Code 2023, ML4SCI project.

The Notebooks directory contains jupyter notebooks of my implementations using pennylane.

The data directory contains sample training data for the SO(2) invariant network as well as trained parameters for the discrete case.

A detailed description is given in the blog post: https://medium.com/@zhontiandong/equivariant-quantum-neural-networks-be4ba231c457
