Discovering new phenomena, like the Higgs boson, involves the identification of rare signals that could shed light into unanswered questions about our universe. On the other hand, at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), large amounts of data are generated from particle collisions. This project is the development of a Lie-Equivariant Quantum Graph Neural Network (Lie-EQGNN) for the Google Summer of Code 2024 with the Machine Learning for Science (ML4SCI) Organization. We implement a quantum model that not only is data efficient, but also has symmetry-preserving properties from any arbitrary Lie algebra that can be learned directly from the data. Given the limitations by noise of current quantum hardware, efficiently designing new parameterized circuit architectures is crucial.

Under the notebooks folder, there is a walkthrough the project, outlining all three steps:
  * Symmetry discovery
  * Invariant metric tensor extraction
  * Lie-EQGNN
    
Additionally, there is a full blog post outlining specific details, given here: https://jogisuda.github.io/posts/2024/07/lie-eqgnn/
